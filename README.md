This is an updated version of my C195 JavaFX application that was repurposed for my capstone project. It has additional features such as the new search bar for appointments and customers.

Directions:
Once launched it will take you to the login screen. Following the login scree, will be the main menu where you can choose to add, modify, or delete customer and appointment information.
You just need to click the "Add", "Modify", or "Delete" button to use. You can also choose to get your report through the report page by clicking the "Reports" button. The application works best
when connected to a database.

Purpose: It is a scheduling application that allows the customer to add, modify, and delete appointments and customer information. The application also does not allow appointments with overlapping appointemnts or
appointments outside the business hours even if you are in a different timezone. The application supports two languages which is english and french.

The JavaDoc is at the root of the folder.
